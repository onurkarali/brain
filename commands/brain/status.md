# /brain:status — Brain Overview Dashboard

You are displaying a comprehensive overview of the Brain Memory system's current state.

## Steps

### 1. Read Brain State

Read `.brain/index.json` to get the full memory inventory. If `.brain/` doesn't exist, inform the user and suggest running `/brain:init`.

Also read (if they exist):
- `.brain/associations.json` — for association network stats
- `.brain/review-queue.json` — for review schedule info
- `.brain/_archived/index.json` — for archive stats
- `.brain/.sync/config.json` — for git sync configuration

### 2. Compute Statistics

For each memory in the index, compute:

```
days_elapsed = (now - last_accessed) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24)
decayed_strength = strength * (decay_rate ^ days_elapsed)
```

Calculate aggregate stats:
- Total memory count
- Memories per top-level category
- Average effective (decayed) strength
- Memories by type distribution
- Memories by cognitive type (episodic / semantic / procedural)
- Total tags (unique count)
- Confidence distribution
- Salience distribution

### 4. Health Check

Analyze the brain's health and provide recommendations:

- **"Healthy"** — Good distribution across categories, strong average strength
- **"Needs consolidation"** — Many memories below threshold, suggest `/brain:consolidate`
- **"Imbalanced"** — One category dominates, suggest diversifying
- **"Stale"** — No new memories in 14+ days, suggest `/brain:memorize`
- **"Overloaded"** — More than 200 active memories, suggest pruning with `/brain:forget --prune`
- **"Needs propagation"** — Recent memories exist alongside older related memories that haven't been updated. Suggest `/brain:sleep`
- **"Needs sleep"** — Multiple flat clusters detected, OR many memories in moderate/weak tiers, OR no `_expertise.md` profiles exist despite having 10+ memories. Suggest `/brain:sleep`
- **"Low confidence"** — More than 30% of memories have confidence < 0.5. Suggest reviewing and validating uncertain memories.
- **"Review overdue"** — More than 10 memories are past their review date. Suggest `/brain:review`
- **"Sync available"** — Git sync is not configured. Suggest `/brain:sync setup` for cross-device access.
- **"Sync stale"** — Last push was more than 7 days ago. Suggest `/brain:sync push`.
